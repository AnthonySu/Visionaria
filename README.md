Visionaria will be a web app that will provide positive and inspiring social feed to allow young girls a safe space 
for positive self-reflection. It'll also allow girls to publish statements and ideas about problems/observations 
they see in their communities and ways they improve them.
Their website can be found here: http://www.thevisionarianetwork.org/
